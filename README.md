<br/>

### Lab0: Half Subtractor and Full Subtractor
Implement the `half subtractor` and `full subtractor` without using `-` operation.

<br/>

### Lab1: 32-bit ALU
Implement a `32-bit ALU` (Arithmetic Logic Unit). ALU is the basic computing component of a CPU. Its operations include AND, OR, addition, subtraction, etc. 

<br/>

### Lab2: Single Cycle CPU - Simple Edition
Utilizing the ALU in Lab1 to implement a `simple single cycle CPU`.

<br/>

### Lab3: Single Cycle CPU - Complete Edition
Based on Lab2, add a memory unit and implement a complete single cycle CPU that can run `R-type`, `I-type` and `jump instructions`.

<br/>

### Lab4: Pipelined CPU
Based on your Lab3 CPU design, implement a `pipelined CPU`. 

<br/>

### Lab 5: Advanced Pipelined CPU
Modify Lab4 CPU design, and implement an advanced pipelined CPU with `hazard detection` and `data forwarding`
